# Computer Vision Project for Cotton Image Classification

## Overview

This MATLAB-based computer vision project focuses on classifying cotton images into different irrigation types using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a random forest classifier to predict the irrigation type based on extracted features from the images.

## Results

- The script generates a confusion matrix, displays correctly classified images, and outputs the overall accuracy of the model.

## Note

- The random seed is set to maintain consistent results across runs.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
